## Introduction

This repository is a showcase of the several projects that I have undertaken using SQL. The projects exhibited here present various aspects of SQL and database management in basic queries, complex data manipulations, and performance optimizations. All of this is to give you an overview of my skills and abilities in working with SQL overall.
