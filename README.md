## Introduction

This repository is a showcase of the several projects that I have undertaken using SQL. The projects exhibited here present various aspects of SQL and database management in basic queries, complex data manipulations, and performance optimizations. All of this is to give you an overview of my skills and abilities in working with SQL overall.

## Projects

### Project 1: SQL Superstore Analysis

Overview:
This project involves creating and managing a SQL database for a superstore. It includes creating a table, inserting data, and performing various queries to demonstrate database management, data analysis, and SQL programming skills. The purpose of this project is to showcase the ability to handle SQL operations, including data insertion, querying, and aggregation.

Skills:

Data Modeling: Creating and structuring the superstore table with appropriate data types and constraints.
Complex Joins and Subqueries: Demonstrating the ability to perform complex queries on the superstore table.
Data Analysis and Reporting: Using SQL queries to analyze data and generate meaningful reports.
Aggregation Functions: Utilizing functions like SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT for data aggregation.
Ordering and Filtering: Using ORDER BY and WHERE clauses to sort and filter data.
